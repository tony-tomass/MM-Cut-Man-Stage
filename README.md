# Mega Man - Cut Man Stage
This is a demo of a game made with Godot 4.3.1 with the intention of helping me learn and practice game development.
The goal of this was to recreate the visual and gameplay aspects as close as possible to the first Mega Man game on the NES from 1987.

As of Feb 12 2025, there is not a playable demo purely because there's not much to do besides killing one specific enemy over and over again on one specific area of the level, and die.
