# Mega Man - Cut Man Stage
This is a demo of a game made with Godot 4.3.1 with the intention of helping me learn and practice game development.
The goal of this was to recreate the visual and gameplay aspects as close as possible to the first Mega Man game on the NES from 1987.

~~As of Feb 12 2025, there is not a playable demo purely because there's not much to do besides killing one specific enemy over and over again on one specific area of the level, and die.~~
A playable build can now be found on my [Itch.io](https://tony-tomass.itch.io/cutman-stage-prototype)!

It features Mega Man - controlled by the player - and his Mega Buster on the Cut Man stage with its cast of different obstacles and enemies.  There are still a good amount of features that are not implemented (health items, points, boss, etc.)
This will not be a full recreation of Mega Man 1 and only served as a way for me to teach myself game development. Like I said earlier, there's still a lot of features that are missing from this, but as of this release, I'm not planning on implementing much else to this project.
